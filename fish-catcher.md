# The fish catcher

## Task 1

Brainstorm the system components.

What are the major challenges? What are the solutions?

Produce a block diagram showing the components.

## Task 2

Use a robot arm to cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

## Notes

Line catching? Spear fishing?

How do we know where the fish are? Echosounders? Navigation?

Can we get somebody to demonstrate line fishing?
