\section{Introduction}

In July 2022, 28 AgriFoRwArdS students participated in a summer school
at the University of East Anglia where they were challenged to
imagine, design, prototype and cost a robot system for catching fish.

AgriForWardS is a Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Agri-Food
Robotics established by the University of Lincoln in collaboration
with the University of Cambridge and University of East Anglia.

    \subsection{Contribution of paper}
Technological trends within the fishing industry are not well documented nor well defined. 
This survey aims to make such identifications and begins by reviewing the specific needs of the fishing industry.
It then discusses the current regulatory framework that fishers operate within.
Each stage of the fisher process is then introduced form finding fish, catching, sorting and preparing. 

\section{The fishing industry}
[GC sub section ideas:

1. regulatory framework

2. current catch and landing trends of UK fishing landscape (fish sellers)

3. Current technologies \cite{b4}

4. Current technology limitations

5. safety in fishing

6. financial considerations

7. drive towards sustainability
