# The-challenge

## Introduction

Imagine you are forming a start-up company that aims to design, build
and operate a fleet of robots to catch fish and serve up fish and
chips.

Your first task is to look at [forming a company](startup.md).

## Concept

The system consists one or more robot arms onboard an unmanned
autonomous vessel.

When the boat is at sea, the robot uses line fishing to catch and land
the fish.

Fish are then identified and sorted. Small fish and bycatch are
returned to the sea. Sea bass and herring are then prepared and put
into cold storage.

When the boat returns to shore, the robot fillets the fish and cooks
fresh fish and chips to be served on the quayside.

## Design

In order to receive investment, five modules must be designed,
prototyped and demonstrated this week:

1. [The fish finder](00-fish-finder/README.md)
2. The fish catcher
3. The fish sorter
4. The fish cooker
5. The fish seller

## Teams

We have split you into five teams, with each team tackling a separate
module.

## Presentation

Each team will be expected to present their design and demonstrate
prototypes to an assembled audience on Thursday evening.
