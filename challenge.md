# The challenge

## Introduction

Imagine you are forming a start-up company to design and build a robot
that catches fish and serves up fish and chips.

## Concept

The robot fits onto the back of an existing fishing boat.

When the boat is at sea, the robot uses line fishing to catch and land
the fish.

Fish are then identified. Small fish and bycatch are returned to the
sea. Cod and haddock are then prepared and put into cold storage.

When the boat returns to shore, the robot cooks fresh fish and chips
to be served on the quayside.

## Design

In order to receive investment, three modules must be designed,
prototyped and demonstrated this week:

1. [The fish catcher](fish-catcher.md)
2. [The fish preparer](fish-preparer.md)
3. [The cooker](cooker.md)

## Teams

We have split you into three teams, with each team tackling a separate
module.

## Presentation

Each team will be expected to present their design and demonstrate
prototypes to an assembled audience on Thursday evening.
