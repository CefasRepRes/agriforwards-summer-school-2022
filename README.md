# AgriFoRwArdS summer school

## Introduction

The
[AgriFoRwArdS](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/latest-phds-and-research-studentships/partnerships-in-doctoral-training/agriforwards)
summer school is being organised by UEA and Cefas to provide training
and development for AgriFoRwArdS CDT students.

- [ ] Confirm student numbers (30?)
- [ ] Confirm date - 4th - 8th June 2022.

The event will include [a challenge](challenge.md), a trip to
[Cefas](cefas.md), a trip to the Norfolk Broads, various
[talks](talks.md), media training, entrepreneurship and
presentations. Please see the [timetable](timetable.md).

Our aim is to quickly produce a minimum viable product (MVP) event and
then iteratively improve it before June.

For each module we want two people - a domain expert and an engineer.

This repository is a work in progress.
