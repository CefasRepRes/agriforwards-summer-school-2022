# AgriFoRwArdS summer school

## Introduction

The
[AgriFoRwArdS](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/latest-phds-and-research-studentships/partnerships-in-doctoral-training/agriforwards)
summer school is being organised by UEA and Cefas to provide training
and development for AgriFoRwArdS CDT students.

- [ ] Confirm student numbers (30?)
- [ ] Confirm date - 4th - 8th July 2022.

The event will include [a challenge](#the-challenge), a trip to
[Cefas](#cefas), a trip to the [Norfolk Broads](#norfolk-broads), various
talks, media training, entrepreneurship and
presentations. Please see the [timetable](#timetable).

Our aim is to quickly produce a minimum viable product (MVP) event and
then iteratively improve it before June.

For each module we want two people - a domain expert and an engineer.

This document is a work in progress.

## The-challenge

### Introduction

Imagine you are forming a start-up company to design and build a robot
that catches fish and serves up fish and chips.

### Concept

The robot fits onto the back of an existing leisure boat.

When the boat is at sea, the robot uses line fishing to catch and land
the fish.

Fish are then identified. Small fish and bycatch are returned to the
sea. Cod and haddock are then prepared and put into cold storage.

When the boat returns to shore, the robot cooks fresh fish and chips
to be served on the quayside.

### Design

- [x] Draft blocks / modules RH.

In order to receive investment, three modules must be designed,
prototyped and demonstrated this week:

1. [The fish catcher](#the-fish-catcher)
2. [The fish preparer](#the-fish-preparer)
3. [The cooker](#the-cooker)

- [ ] Consider how many students per module - do we need more modules?
- [ ] Finalise the list of modules.
- [ ] Appoint a mentor / leader for each module.

### Teams

We have split you into three teams, with each team tackling a separate
module.

### Presentation

Each team will be expected to present their design and demonstrate
prototypes to an assembled audience on Thursday evening.

## The fish catcher

### Introduction

This robot must cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

### Task

Use a robot arm to cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

- [ ] What tools are there for simulating robot arms? Ask Lincoln (RH)
- [ ] Book the robotic equipment.
- [ ] Find out how to program the UEA robot arms.

### Notes

Line catching? Spear fishing?

How do we know where the fish are? Echosounders? Navigation?

- [ ] Can we get somebody to demonstrate line fishing?

## The fish preparer

### Introduction

This robot must use a vision system to sort wanted fish from bycatch.

### Task

- [ ] Michal to propose a machine learning, fish classification exercise

### Notes

Identify the fish. Throw back the bycatch. Get the retained fish into
storage.

Do the fish need to be humanely killed?

Freezer or live-well?

Soft handling problem

Computer vision

## The Cooker

### Introduction

This robot must fillet the fish and cook it.

### Task

Program a robot arm to pick up fish, put them in a "deep fat fryer",
put the lid on and then retrieve the fish after x minutes.

- [ ] Ask the Holbeach National Centre for Food Manufacturing (Mark Swainson) for advice (RH).

### Notes

Do we have a kitchen? Perhaps one of the local technical colleges
could help?

Conveyor belt?

What about the batter? Mixing? Ingredients.

Deep fat fryer.

Safety issues.

Perhaps we use rubber fish and a pretend setup

## Media training

### Unannounced crisis

E.g. *A fictional government report says that high levels of mercury
have been found in benthic fish. You have been invited to appear on
BBC Breakfast TV to comment*

### Content

Role play media interviews. Can we get some video cameras in?

Feedback, discussion and training.

## Teams

- [ ] Look at skill set of the students and allocate them to modules accordingly.

### Team 1

TBD

### Team 2

TBD

### Team 3

TBD

## Cefas

- [x] Reserve Cefas lecture theatre.
- [ ] Arrange transport - train?


### Talks and demonstrations

- [ ] Can we get a Cefas talk on sustainable fishing /  Issues around fish and chips?

TBD

UAVs?

## Norfolk Broads

Trip out to see the Broads and get a flavour of the blue economy leisure industry.

Take some UEA and Cefas people so that students get an opportunity to talk and network.

- [ ] Broad Authority Education officer talk.
- [ ] Oulton Broad paddle steamer.
- [ ] Invite selected Cefas and UEA people (CCSUS?) to accompany to The Broads.

## Corporate website task

### Introduction

Design and build a simple, one-page corporate website to officially
represent your start-up on the Web.

### Things to consider

What purposes should a company website fulfil?

What information should the website contain?

How important are logos, branding, styling and choice of colour?

### Task

Design a single-page web site using either HTML or Markdown, and add
it to the event's GitHub repository.

### Deliverable

A single page website that that represents you start-up on the
Web. (80% of the marks will be awarded for content and 20% for
presentation).
