# AgriFoRwArdS summer school

## Introduction

The
[AgriFoRwArdS](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/latest-phds-and-research-studentships/partnerships-in-doctoral-training/agriforwards)
summer school is being organised by UEA and Cefas to provide training
and development for AgriFoRwArdS CDT students. There are 28
students. The dates are confirmed as 4th - 8th July 2022.

The event will include [a challenge](#the-challenge), a trip to
[Cefas](#cefas), a trip to the [Norfolk Broads](#norfolk-broads), various
talks, media training, entrepreneurship and
presentations. Please see the [timetable](#timetable).

Our aim is to quickly produce a minimum viable product (MVP) event and
then iteratively improve it before July.

For each module we want two people - a domain expert and an engineer.

This document is a work in progress.

## The-challenge

### Introduction

Imagine you are forming a start-up company to design and build a robot
that catches fish and serves up fish and chips.

### Concept

The robot fits onto the back of an existing leisure boat or an
unmanned autonomous vessel.

When the boat is at sea, the robot uses line fishing to catch and land
the fish.

Fish are then identified and sorted. Small fish and bycatch are
returned to the sea. Sea bass and herring are then prepared and put
into cold storage.

When the boat returns to shore, the robot fillets the fish and cooks
fresh fish and chips to be served on the quayside.

### Design

In order to receive investment, X modules must be designed, prototyped
and demonstrated this week:

0. [The fish finder](#the-fish-finder) an option for consideration
1. [The fish catcher](#the-fish-catcher)
2. [The fish sorter](#the-fish-sorter) could support three sub groups
3. [The cooker](#the-cooker)
4. [The fish seller](#the-fish-seller) an option for consideration

- [ ] Finalise the list of modules.

### Teams

We have split you into X teams, with each team tackling a separate
module.

### Presentation

Each team will be expected to present their design and demonstrate
prototypes to an assembled audience on Thursday evening.

## The fish finder

- [ ] Decide whether this option is a goer.

### Introduction

Software must navigate the (autonomous?) vessel to the fishing
grounds, considering collision avoidance and selecting the most
profitable areas to fish.

### Task

Given data about bathymetry, windfarms and shipping (AIS), determine
an optimal fishing location and plot a route to get there. Show your
results in a GIS system.

### Notes

The task could involve talking to Cefas about the locations of fishing
grounds and the factors affecting fish abundance etc (Jeroen?)

This could be an interesting modelling, data science and GIS exercise.

## The fish catcher

- [ ] RH to lead on this until we appoint a module owner
- [ ] Ask Kieran Hyder to advise on line fishing aspects

### Introduction

This robot must cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

### Task

Use a robot arm to cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

- [ ] What tools are there for simulating robot arms? Ask Lincoln (RH)
- [ ] Book the robotic equipment.
- [ ] Find out how to program the UEA robot arms.
- [ ] Can we get some model fishes?
- [ ] Can we get somebody to demonstrate line fishing?

### Notes

Line catching for sustainability.

## The fish sorter

[x] Michal to design, build and lead this module which could have
three sub-groups.

### Introduction

This robot must use a vision system to sort wanted fish from bycatch.

### Task A

- [ ] Michal to propose a machine learning, fish classification exercise

### Task B

- [ ] Michal to propose a machine learning, fish classification exercise

### Task C

- [ ] Michal to propose a machine learning, fish classification exercise

### Notes

Computer vision / image processing problem.

Task variations include - dealing with bias / class imbalance. Image
augmentation. Different cameras etc.

## The Cooker

- [ ] RH to lead on this until we appoint a module owner

### Introduction

This robot must fillet the fish and cook it with chips.

### Task

Program a robot arm to pick up fish, put them in a "deep fat fryer",
put the lid on and then retrieve the fish after x minutes.

- [ ] Ask the Holbeach National Centre for Food Manufacturing (Mark Swainson) for advice (RH).

### Notes

Doing this with a real deep fat fryer seems infeasible/. Perhaps we
use rubber fish and a pretend setup?

Do we have a kitchen? Perhaps one of the local technical colleges
could help?

Conveyor belt?

What about the batter? Mixing? Ingredients.

Safety issues.

- [ ] Firm up this idea

## The fish seller

- [ ] Decide whether this option is a goer.

### Introduction

Once the fish is cooked you need to serve it and take the money.

### Task

Program a robot to wrap up the fish and chips in newspaper.

## Media training

### Unannounced crisis

E.g. *An unmanned autonomous vehicle has just collided with a wind turbine
in the North Sea. One person is injured. You have been invited to
appear on BBC Breakfast TV to comment*

### Content

Role play media interviews. Can we get some video cameras in?

Feedback, discussion and training.

- [ ] RH to lead?
- [ ] Get some cameras in?

## Teams

- [ ] Look at skill set of the students and allocate them to modules accordingly.
- [ ] Consider a questionnaire to find out more about the students and
      what they'd like to learn.

## Cefas

- [x] Reserve Cefas lecture theatre.

- [ ] Julie to consider the list of speakers and topics
- [ ] Can we get a Cefas talk on sustainable fishing /  Issues around fish and chips?

Which species are more or less sustainable and shy?

#### Overview of Cefas and Cefas science

JB?

Becca Skirrow (fisheries)?

#### Data Science and Statistics at Cefas

Rob to talk about machine learning. Joe Riberio?

#### Marine imagery

Jon Hawes / John Sperry (marine underwater imagery)?

#### Kieran Hyder Talk and QA

The value chain for fish. What can I buy a sea bass for on the
quayside? What are the volume discounts? How much would I pay at the
supermarket? At a fishmonger? At a London restaurant?

## Norfolk Broads

Trip out to see the Broads and get a flavour of the blue economy leisure industry.

Take some UEA and Cefas people so that students get an opportunity to talk and network.

- [ ] Broad Authority Education officer talk?
- [ ] Oulton Broad paddle steamer?
- [ ] Invite selected Cefas and UEA people (CCSUS?) to accompany to The Broads.

- [ ] Ask Mavis to consider the options.

## Corporate website task

- [ ] Decide whether this option is a goer.

### Introduction

Design and build a simple, one-page corporate website to officially
represent your start-up on the Web.

### Things to consider

What purposes should a company website fulfil?

What information should the website contain?

How important are logos, branding, styling and choice of colour?

### Task

Design a single-page web site using either HTML or Markdown, and add
it to the event's GitHub repository.

### Deliverable

A single page website that that represents you start-up on the
Web. (80% of the marks will be awarded for content and 20% for
presentation).

### Notes

The intention is to get the students to consider the whole project
before diving into the detail.

## Other

- [x] Confirm numbers - 28
- [x] Confirm dates
- [x] Confirm accommodation availability.
- [ ] Book UEA accommodation for Rob please.
- [ ] Ask students for their GitHub accounts.
