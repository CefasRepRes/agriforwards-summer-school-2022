# AgriFoRwArdS summer school

## Introduction

The
[AgriFoRwArdS](https://www.uea.ac.uk/research/research-with-us/postgraduate-research/latest-phds-and-research-studentships/partnerships-in-doctoral-training/agriforwards)
summer school is being organised by UEA and Cefas to provide training
and development for 28 AgriFoRwArdS CDT students. Based at The UEA in
Norwich, the dates are confirmed as 4th - 8th July 2022.

The event will include [a challenge](#the-challenge), a trip to
[Cefas](#cefas), various talks, media training, entrepreneurship and
presentations. Please see the [timetable](#timetable).


For each module we want two people - a domain expert and an engineer.

## The-challenge

### Introduction

Imagine you are forming a start-up company that aims to design, build
and operate a fleet of robots to catch fish and serve up fish and
chips.

Fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations.

Managed correctly, aquatic environments are an important source of
food.

### Concept

The system consists of a robot arm onboard an unmanned autonomous
vessel.

When the boat is at sea, the robot uses line fishing to catch and land
the fish.

Fish are then identified and sorted. Small fish and bycatch are
returned to the sea. Sea bass and herring are then prepared and put
into cold storage.

When the boat returns to shore, the robot fillets the fish and cooks
fresh fish and chips to be served on the quayside.

### Design

In order to receive investment, five modules must be designed,
prototyped and demonstrated this week:

0. [The fish finder](#the-fish-finder)
1. [The fish catcher](#the-fish-catcher)
2. [The fish sorter](#the-fish-sorter)
3. [The fish cooker](#the-cooker)
4. [The fish seller](#the-fish-seller) an option for consideration

### Teams

We have split you into five teams, with each team tackling a separate
module.

### Presentation

Each team will be expected to present their design and demonstrate
prototypes to an assembled audience on Thursday evening.

## The fish finder

### Introduction

Software must navigate the autonomous vessel to the fishing grounds,
considering collision avoidance and minimising fuel costs.

- [ ] RB to flesh this out a bit more detail and consult Kieran to
      try to make it realistic or at least plausible.

### Task

Given data about bathymetry, windfarms and shipping (AIS), determine
an optimal fishing location and plot a passage plan. Show your results
on a map.

- [ ] RB to explore UKHO and other GIS data sets. Contact Paulette
      Posen (insight project, wrecks, GIS layers etc).

AIS data?

Consider using some kind of constraint satisfaction / linear
optimisation framework? Random utility models are used in
economics. Variables include cost, distance, probability etc.

Fishing grounds are dependent on habitat, tidal aspects etc. but we
will probably just use poetic licence and make up some suitable
location. Also which species? Bait hook and line? etc.

### Notes

The task could involve talking to Cefas about the locations of fishing
grounds and the factors affecting fish abundance etc (Jeroen?)

This could be an interesting modelling, data science and GIS exercise.

Could involve aspects of fleet robotics, safety, weather, logistics.

## The fish catcher

### Introduction

This robot must cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

KH Notes that line casting is hard, so we may wish to simplify the
problem using jogging arms, general bait fishing and electric
reels. Perhaps considering mixed fishing, bottom bait cod / whiting /
flatfish.

### Task

Use a robot arm to cast a line, catch a fish and land it.

- [ ] What tools are there for simulating robot arms? Ask Lincoln (RH)
- [ ] Book the robotic equipment.
- [ ] Find out how to program the UEA robot arms.
- [ ] Can we get hold of some rods and line?
- [ ] Can we get some model fishes?
- [ ] Can we get somebody to demonstrate line fishing? Could the students have a go?

### Notes

Line catching for sustainability.

## The fish sorter

### Introduction

This robot must use a vision system to sort wanted fish from
bycatch. As such it needs segmentation, classification and
measurement.

KH Notes that images are from general demersal fishery - cod, haddock
, whiting etc.

### Notes

Computer vision / image processing problem.

Task variations include - dealing with bias / class imbalance. Image
augmentation. Different cameras etc. Segmentation. Measurement,

## The Cooker

### Introduction

This robot must fillet the fish and cook it with chips.

### Task

Program a robot arm to pick up fish, put them in a "deep fat fryer",
put the lid on and then retrieve the fish after x minutes.

- [ ] Ask the Holbeach National Centre for Food Manufacturing (Mark Swainson) for advice (RH).

### Notes

Doing this with a real deep fat fryer seems infeasible/. Perhaps we
use rubber fish and a pretend setup?

Do we have a kitchen? Perhaps one of the local technical colleges
could help?

Conveyor belt?

What about the batter? Mixing? Ingredients.

Safety issues.

## The fish seller

### Introduction

You need to market the product and manage supply and demand.

### Task

KH Notes that there are a number of apps that connect individual
fishers with markets. E.g. [Abalobi](http://abalobi.org) . KH could
put us in touch with the founder.

A web app ? - RH TBD

## Media training

### Unannounced crisis

E.g. *An unmanned autonomous vehicle has just collided with a wind turbine
in the North Sea. One person is injured. You have been invited to
appear on BBC Breakfast TV to comment*

### Content

Role play media interviews. Can we get some video cameras in?

Feedback, discussion and training.

- [ ] Get some cameras in?

## Cefas

Which species are more or less sustainable and why?

#### Overview of Cefas and Cefas science

JB?

Becca Skirrow (fisheries)?

#### Data Science and Statistics at Cefas

Rob to talk about machine learning. Joe Riberio, Data Science?

#### Marine imagery

Jon Hawes / John Sperry (marine underwater imagery)?

#### Kieran Hyder Talk and QA

The value chain for fish. What can I buy a sea bass for on the
quayside? What are the volume discounts? How much would I pay at the
supermarket? At a fishmonger? At a London restaurant?


## Norfolk Broads

Trip out to see the Broads and get a flavour of the blue economy leisure industry.

Take some UEA and Cefas people so that students get an opportunity to talk and network.

- [ ] Broad Authority Education officer talk?
- [ ] Oulton Broad paddle steamer?
- [ ] Invite selected Cefas and UEA people (CCSUS?) to accompany to The Broads.

- [ ] Ask Mavis to consider the options.

## Corporate website task

- [ ] Decide whether this option is a goer.

### Introduction

Design and build a simple, one-page corporate website to officially
represent your start-up on the Web.

### Things to consider

What purposes should a company website fulfil?

What information should the website contain?

How important are logos, branding, styling and choice of colour?

### Task

Design a single-page web site using either HTML or Markdown, and add
it to the event's GitHub repository.

### Deliverable

A single page website that that represents you start-up on the
Web. (80% of the marks will be awarded for content and 20% for
presentation).

### Notes

The intention is to get the students to consider the whole project
before diving into the detail.
