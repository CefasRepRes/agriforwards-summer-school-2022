# AgriFoRwArdS Summer School 2022

## Ideas log that did not make it to presentations

### Team sellers 
- Learning from demonstration for rod casting, net casting, fish baiting, chumping etc [///example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JxQ81NqOIM)
- Using underwater cameras to specifically target fish species for catch (i.e. sees unwanted catch and avoids somehow) - builds on sorting tool in the summer school
- build on the 'digital fish' concept and not treat the digital fish as the same information flow as the physical fish. i.e. fish selling can be done in real time with size, weight etc id'd at catch autonomously
- Digitizing the process removes physical hardstops such as markets. Leverage this by new aucting processes to build co-operatives. Extend this concept to real time at catch point quota sharing and leasing [///example](https://www.oecd.org/environment/resources/Policy-Paper-Sustaining-Iceland-fisheries-through-tradeable-quotas.pdf) Extension of[///fishcoin](fishcoin) and blockchain fish based traceability system that tokenises catch
- Fishing as a Service - we see this model growing all around us. Netflix to cars we use to our own home internet (we don't own the modem box for instance). This has large potential in the circular economy and fishing particular.

- real time species management building using AI catch but also data driven from auctioning system
