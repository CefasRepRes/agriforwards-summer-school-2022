# The fish catcher

## Introduction

There are many methods of catching fish. However, many of these methods can 
contribute to significant by-catch. It has been shown that commercial fishing 
with hook and line is more sustainable 
[[1](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/maldives-set-example-sustainable-seafood-value-chains)]. 
The challenge is to now automate this process, so that a number of vessles could 
act as an automous fleet with the intention of supplying freshly caught fish to a 
local, land-based vending site, in a just-in-time supply methodology.

## Automation of the line fishing process.

It is the task of the <i>fish-catcher</i> team to provide a working, 
prototype that can perform the operations necessary for fishing 
with a 'hook-and-line' tackle. (NB: To expedite the demonstration, plastic fish with magnets will be used in initial work). This proof-of-concept will be pesented at an investor event scheduled for Thursday evening.

While the exact methodology of fishing still undecided, there are several 
key steps that the automated fisher must complete. These are:

- Deployment of the fishing tackle.
- Controlling the lure in the water.
- Detection of a fish on, or taking, the line.
- Presentation of the catch for identification.
- The ability to deliver the catch to a keep net or release it.

It is crucial that you demonstrate control of hardware responding to sensor data from the fishing aparatus. Your answer should consider the operation on an unmanned vessle, the cost of the hardware and ability to produce the hardware at scale. 

Further to this, there are also a number of technical issues that have been 
quietly mentioned in meetings which it might be worth considering. These are, 

- What is the best tackle or method used to catch the various target species? 
- Might it be possible to have a common-core system with 'tools' depending on fishing method? What might this look like?
- Which hook technology should be used? Will it be removed and reused or single use? 

Ideas welcome.
 
## Facilities

The use of Productivity East has been secured for this early prototyping work. They have a large number of facilities that will be at your disposal. However, a collection of prototyping hardware has also been provided to aid you in your work. This includes:

- single-board computers, 
- microcontrollers, 
- sensors, 
- actuators and motors (with their associated drivers), 
- a selection of suitable materials and components from which to construct the prototype. 

You will also have access to the rapid-prototyping facilities of our Hosts. These can be accessed by liaising with the staff.
