# Starting a start-up

## Introduction

How would you go about starting a new company?

Design and build a simple, one-page corporate website to launch your
company.

### Things to consider

What would be a good company name?

What purposes should a company website fulfil?

What information should the website contain?

How important are logos, branding, styling and choice of colour?

### Task

Design a single-page web site using either HTML, Markdown, Word,
PowerPoint or hand drawn sketches. (We are interested in your ideas
and design more than your web site skills!).

### Deliverable

A single page website that that represents your start-up on the
Web.
